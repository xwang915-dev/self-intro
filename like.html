                <h2>Dance</h2>
                <p>
                    I like to dance kpop. First of all, KPOP has a fast rhythm. I like fast music and it sounds very energetic. Secondly, the music melody is good. The Korean music style is very similar to the American disco music, and the melody is also very positive. Finally, in the world, there are a few singers who can dance, but in Korea, most groups dance, and the dance moves are very handsome.

                    I like to go on a trip. During the journey, I can relax myself well, forget the pressure brought by learning, forget all the troubles, and adjust my state to cope with the future life. During the trip, I can watch the historic sites, feel the wisdom of our ancestors, open our eyes, infect our quality, and improve our quality.

                    After the age of 20, my life seems to have doubled its speed. Many beautiful things in my life have passed inadvertently, so I want to record my good life through photography.
